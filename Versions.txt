GAME PROJECT: 

FOR GRADED WORK:


Dear grader!

Here listed are all the varialbes you are looking for:

Since TREES_X are in the constant object BACKG_EL in levelController.js I made the with 
uppcase letters. The same is the case for the other variables. Since they are in a constant 
object they are written with uppercase letters!
TREES_X and TREES_Y are initialized in the setup function bellow.
The code for writing the trees drawTrees() is in backgroundElements.js
The trees are drawn in draw() together with all the objets in BACKG_EL.BACKG_EL array of objects.


MOUNTAIN is a single object that is initialized in setup() bellow.
It is a part of the object DIST_BACKG_EL that stores all distant background elements from levelController.js
The code for drawMountain is in drawDistantBackgroundElements.js
Mountain is drawn in draw with the drawMountain function.


CLOUDS_X is an array of cloud x positions that is initialized as a part of the constant object DIST_BACKG_EL from levelController.js 
It is together with other cloud variables like CLOUDS_Y CLOUDS_SIZE_X and CLOUD_SCROLL
The code to draw the clouds is in drawDistantBackgroundElements.js


CANYONS_X is an array of canyon positions that is initialized  as a part of constant object INTER_EL from levelController.js
The Code for use of canyons is in the levelController.js  while the code to draw si in the drawInteractableElements.js


HAMMER is declared and initialized BEFORE setup bellow as a global object.
This is my pickable object!
The logic of picking up the hammer is in levelController.js while the code to draw it is in the drawObjects.js



Under work:


Verion 0.000001  25. Desember.2020
Fixed tide of day 26.12.2020
Fixed sun movement 26.12.2020
Stared fixing sun color 

NB!! If you are searching for the variables like trees_x, clouds_x mountains_x and so on, They are in uppercase letters because they are part of constant objects.
